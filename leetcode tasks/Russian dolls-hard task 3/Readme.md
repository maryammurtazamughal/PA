# Maximum Envelopes Problem

This Python script solves the maximum envelopes problem using dynamic programming. 
It calculates the maximum number of envelopes that can be stacked inside one another based on width and height criteria.

#Problem Description

You are given a collection of envelopes, where each envelope is a 2D array `[width, height]`.
 The problem is to find the maximum number of envelopes you can stack inside one another. 
An envelope can only be stacked if its width and height are both strictly smaller than 
the width and height of the other envelope.

#work flow

The code defines a Python class `Solution` with a method `maxEnvelopes(envelopes)` 
that takes a list of envelopes as input and returns the maximum number of envelopes that can be stacked.

The algorithm involves sorting the envelopes based on width and height and then using dynamic programming to find the maximum stackable envelopes.
