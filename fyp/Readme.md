# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
## Discription
       Diabetic Retinopathy is a cndition in  which retina is demage due to diabetes,leading to loss of vision and potentially blindness if not diagnosed and treated early,
       This project utilized convolutional neural networks to classify retinal image into 5 categories: Mild, Moderate, NO_Dr, Poliferate_DR, Severe
## Intsall neccessary libraries:
  Tensorflow
  keras
  pandas
  numpy
  matplotlib
  transfer learning vgg16 model
## setup Kaggle API:
  obtain a kaggle API key from your kaggle account
## Model Training:
   load and preprocess data
   Define and compile the model
   Train the model
## Results
   After training the model performance can be evaluated on the test set. The training curves for loss and accuracy can be plotted to visualize the model's learning process.
